This is the CoBaLD Annotation Project Github page. Here we present the linguistic annotation standard and publish datasets annotated according to it.

CobaLD Annotation includes morphological, syntactic and semantic markup. The morphosyntax level relies on the UD markup (ссылка), the semantic pattern is based on the Compreno markup (ссылка). Namely, CoBaLD Annotation is a kind of the UD markup enriched with the semantical pattern which, in turn, includes the annotation of word  meanings and the annotation of the relations between words.

Currently, 2 corpora annotated according to the given standard are available:

(1) Russian news corpus: it includes more than 400 000 tokens and has the morphosyntax of the 'basic' UD model;

(2) English news corpus: it includes more than 150 000 tokens and has the morphosyntax of the Enhanced UD model.
